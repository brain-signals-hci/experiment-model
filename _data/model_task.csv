Participant Restraints,"This attribute relates to any instructions or physical restraints, which were in place during the experiment to avoid artifacts or other undesired effects influencing the signal.",the participants were instructed to refrain from excessive movement by keeping arms at rest on the table in a position that allowed them to reach the keyboard without excessive movement.,Crk:2015:UPE:2872314.2829945
Output devices,"Describes through which devices (e.g., computer screen, mobile phone, etc.) information and material is communicated to the user. As many brain activity patterns are sensitive to the specific characteristics of the stimulation, details of the presentation may be reported.",The [...] game stimulus was run on a powerful high-end gaming PC (CPU: Intel® Core ™ i7-6850K @ 3.60 GHz; RAM: 32 GB; GPU: NVIDIA Geforce GTX 1080) and displayed on a 27-inch BenQ ZOWIE XL2720 144 hz gaming monitor at a 1920x1080 resolution.,TERKILDSEN201964
Input devices,Describes through which devices (besides the brain signal itself) the user communicates commands and other types of input to the system.,HMD-mounted Leap Motion (https://www. leapmotion.com) to track participants’ hands.,skola2019
User Input,Describes which kind of commands and input users can enter into the system at which point of the task. May specify which input devices are used and whether there are any requirements or restrictions to the input.,"They had to respond to auditory notifications whenever one was presented, with a button press using either their left or right index fingers. Six notifications (i.e., 3 complementary pairs of verbal commands and auditory icons) were pre-assigned to a left index-finger press and the remaining six, to a right index-finger press.",Glatz:2018:URS:3173574.3174046
Middleware/  Communication,"For interactive applications or distributed recording setups, this attribute reports how the different parts communicate to exchange data, triggers, commands, etc. ",We wrote a custom Java bridge program to connect the headset to the Android OS and Unity application on the Game tablet. The Java program polled the headset 60 times a second for EEG power spectrum [...] We connected the Calibrate tablet to the Game tablet using WiFi Direct [...].,Antle:2018:OUD:3175498.3131607
Framework/  Technical platform,"What software or development toolkit (in what version) was used as the foundation to implement the task (e.g., PsychoPy, Unity, etc.)","The scene was developed using Unity version 2017.3.0f3, for the representation of hands, the realistically looking hand models ``Pepper Hands'' from Leap Motion suite were used (visible in Figure 3).",skola2019
Task Functionality,"Reports what functionality the involved software provides to the user (in the case of a working interactive application) and how it responds to different user input. For experiments which are based on or inspired by established paradigms (e.g., from cognitive psychology), this source may be reported (e.g., in reference to a source such as the Cognitive Atlas.",the main task for the study is a multi-robot version of the task introduced in [27]. Participants remotely supervised two robots (the blue robot and the red robot) that were exploring different areas of a virtual environment. Participants were told that the two robots had collected information that needed to be transmitted back to the control center. [continues...],Solovey:2012:BEI:2207676.2208372
Architecture,"For experiments which involve non-trivial custom software artifacts, this attribute reports the underlying software architecture, informing about structure of and information flow between modules.",,
Stimulus Material,"For tasks which involve the repeated presentation of uniform stimuli (e.g., pictures to rate, text prompts to enter, etc.), this attribute reports the form of these stimuli (e.g., picture size, length, language, etc.) and their source.","To prepare experimental materials, a dataset of notifications from the websites Notification Sounds and Appraw were collected. Seven musically trained raters were recruited to determine the melody complexity of the 40 notifications. […] (The stimuli can be downloaded at https://goo.gl/SnZrzG).",Cherng:2019:MIM:3290605.3300639
Visualization provided?,"This attribute reports visually (through screen shots or video) the task as shown to the user. If the task has multiple distinct parts, all of them may be visualized. If the task is not in English, the visualization may be accompanied by a translation.",,
Timing,"Reports on if and how the task is (partially) paced by an internal clock, for example for controlling the duration for stimulus presentation or the time time for responding to a prompt.","Each trial began with a black screen for 3s, followed by a fixation dot in the center of the screen for 200ms. After that, the screen remains clear for 200ms before one of four stimuli was displayed for 300ms.",Vi:2014:ERN:2611222.2557015
Code for task provided?,"Reports on whether the task is provided in source code or an executable file and under what licence. If custom hardware is involved, this could also include a blueprint or a circuit diagram.",,
