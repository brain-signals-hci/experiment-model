Derivation of labels,"Outside neurofeedback applications the recorded brain signal data is distributed between multiple groups or assigned a continuous value. This attribute may report how the label is derived from the collected data (e.g.\ defined by the experiment structure, by questionnaire responses, or external ratings).","We considered the mean of the three NASA-TLX parameters (effort, mental demand and frustration) to evaluate the overall mental workload. The average score was thresholded at the mean value of 2 (since the used scale was 0–4) to quantize or characterize a parameter block as inducing low/high workload."
Data transformation,"This attribute refers to all processing steps which transform raw data while keeping it in the original time-domain representation. Examples of such transformation steps are: re-referencing, baseline normalization, downsampling, etc.",the common average was subtracted from all EEG channels.
Filtering,"This attribute reports any filtering of the data. This may include the type of filter applied as well as necessary parameters, such as the filter order.","EEG data was first low-pass filtered with a cutoff frequency of $50hz$ and high-pass filtered with a cutoff frequency of $0.16hz$, both using a third-order butterworth filter"
Windowing,"This attribute reports how segments of data are aligned (e.g.\ locked to an event in the experiment), how long they are and with which window function they are extracted.","The data was then segmented into 1.5-second epochs, overlapping each previous epoch by $50\%$"
Artifact cleaning,Reports through which algorithms (beyond filtering) artifacts were removed and which artifacts are targeted.,Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is applied [\dots] The components are first filtered using a band-pass filter with cut off frequencies 1 - 6 Hz. Choosing the component with the highest energy [and] applying a high-pass filter with a cut off frequency of 20 Hz.
Hyperparameter optimization,"For machine learning models, this attribute reports how the hyperparameters of the model were chosen (e.g.\ through grid search) and which hyperparameters where chosen in the final model. This also includes other parameters of the processing pipeline which are optimized (e.g.\ in preprocessing).","A grid search was performed to optimize sigma for all participants, the remaining parameters were left as default."
Outlier handling,"Reports any methods for excluding certain samples, windows, or sessions based on the contained data or other external factors.",Any rest or trial period with 20 percent or higher error rate is considered noisy and can be excluded from the analysis
Feature extraction,This attribute reports on how a feature vector for classification or regression is calculated from the preprocessed data.,"[W]e partitioned each data window into smaller segments of 50 ms length. We then used the signal mean of the segment, calculated on the band-pass filtered signal, with cutoff frequencies at 4 and 13 Hz (i.e. $\theta$- and $\alpha$-bands).}"
Feature selection,This attribute reports on procedures to reduce the number of features automatically.,we performed a feature selection using the Fisher ratio as selection criterion. The number k of selected features [\dots] was a tuning parameter in the range between 5 and 50.
Learning model,This attribute reports on the specific machine learning model that is employed (if any) to perform classification or regression.,"the Neural Network Toolbox of MATLAB was used to create an artificial neural network (ANN) with 198 inputs, 20 hidden neurons and 4 outputs. The patternnetfunction, which creates a feed-forward neural network, was used. [...]"
Evaluation procedure,"For machine learning models, this attribute reports how they were evaluated to assess their performance. This involves the exact metric used for assessment as well as the approach to (sometimes repeatedly) determine test and training data sets.","To assess the classifiers’ performance on the calibration data, we used 4-fold cross-validation (CV). [\dots] The performance was measured using the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUROCC)."
Processing code provided?,"Reports if the code for processing the brain signal data is released with the paper or in a separate repository. If the code cannot be provided, as a substitute it is possible to report the employed frameworks (e.g.\ EEGLAB).","The full classification pipeline is implemented in Python. For EEG processing, we use the MNE toolbox [17]. For machine learning and evaluation algorithms, we use scikit [28] and custom routines build on numpy and scipy."
