Experiment Structure,"Order of different segments of the experiment, such as instruction, sensor placement, training, debriefing, etc. For ``in-the-wild'' experiments, which do not follow a fixed, predefined pattern, this attribute may report the boundary conditions and which parts of the experiment could be.","\textbullet 5-10min of explanation (slideshow with a detailed description of the interface), \textbullet 5min to set up the hardware,  \textbullet For each BCI paradigm: 10min of calibration, familiarization \textbullet 10min to play the game \textbullet 5min of rest \textbullet Questionnaires"
Instructions,"Instructions given to the participants regarding purpose of experiment, experiment setup, task operations, restrictions, safety considerations, etc. If possible, the written instruction documents may be provided.","Participants were instructed to focus visual attention on a target symbol, whilst silently counting the number of times the target character flashed."
Training procedure,"This attribute reports about how the participants familiarized themselves with the task. it may report the duration of training, specific training conditions compared to the main experiment, and specific training instructions.",All participants first undertook a training task where they played 15 easy and 15 hard pieces on the piano. Each piece was 30 seconds long with a 30-second rest between each piece.
Trial ordering,"For any experiment that is organized in trials, this attribute reports how the ordering of the blocks was derived. It may report whether and how ordering differed between participants.",The order of conditions was counter-balanced across subjects and participants wore the fNIRS device during both trials so they did not notice a difference between the two conditions.
"Repetitions, blocks \& breaks","This attribute reports the larger structure of the experiments, such as blocks of trials and their duration, ordering as well as pauses between blocks. If applicable also reports stopping criteria, if these are individual.","Each session comprised four testing blocks: two using club ambient noise and two using city street ambient noise as standard stimuli. Between any two consecutive blocks, subjects had three minutes to rest."
Pre-study screenings,"Reports any procedures prior to the experiment that determine the eligibility of a participant for the study, their assignments to an experiment group or other aspects of the experiment process.","None of the subjects had any history of brain disease, drug use, or hearing problems. None had any musical expertise."
Questionnaires,"Reports which questionnaires were administered before, during and after the experiment. May give a reference to a published questionnaire or list the items of a custom one. May also report when and how often questionnaires were administered and through what means (paper or computer-based).","At the end of the evaluation, end-users were asked to complete the NASA-TLX, the eQUEST 2.0, and a customized usability questionnaire. [\dots] After each session was complete, the therapist station would automatically open up on the laptop and ask the user to answer, How satisfied were you with the BCI session? (with 10 being very satisfied and 0 is not satisfied) [continues \dots]"
