Brain Input effect,"This attribute describes how the output of the brain input processing influences the design, the behavior, or the content of the application or experimental paradigm.","when the system was confident that the user was in a state of low or high workload, one UAV would be added or removed, respectively. After a UAV was added or removed, there was a 20 second period where no more vehicles were added or removed.",Afergan:2014:DDU:2611222.2557230
Type of integration,"This attribute describes the algorithmic implementation of the brain signal integration, i.e., whether an explicit conditional statement, an Influence Diagram, a state graph, or a different way of behavior modeling was used.","[The self-correction algorithm] inspects the probability distribution [...] and picks the now highest scoring class [...]. [W]e only used the second best class if its re-normalized confidence [...] is above a certain threshold T [...]. Otherwise, the user was asked to repeat the input.",Putze:2015:DES:2702123.2702184
