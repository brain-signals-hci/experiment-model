Type of Sensor,"For a given brain sensing modality, report the manufacturer and the specification of the sensor chain employed.",The EEG was recorded using a NeuroScan system with 32 Ag-AgCl electrodes,lee2014
Sensor Position,"Report where on the scalp electrodes are positioned. For EEG, this is most often done in terms of the 10-20 positioning system or its refinements. For fNIRS, the placement of transmitters and receivers has to be distinguished and the respective distances need to be reported.","Electrodes were positioned according to the extended 10-20 system on CPz, POz, Oz, Iz, O1 and O2",Evain:2017:ITS:3025453.3026037
Sampling Rate,Report the number of samples recorded per second in Hz.,A sampling rate of EEG signals was set as 300 Hz.,Terasawa:2017:TLS:3136755.3136772
Measurement Quality,"For EEG, the threshold for the maximum impedance level (in k&Omega;) is often reported. For fNIRS, no standardized quality measurement exists, different devices provide different ways of measurement (e.g. photon count).",electrode impedance was below 5 K&Omega;,vi2014
Reference,"Specific to the EEG signal, it is custom to report the electrode to which the recording was referenced.",Two electrodes were located at both earlobes as reference and ground.,Terasawa:2017:TLS:3136755.3136772
Auxiliary signals,"The brain sensing modality may not be the only signal, which is captured during the experiment. Often, other sensors, such as eye trackers or heart rate monitors are employed. For these, similar information as for the brain sensing modality may be reported, especially about the specific type of sensor and its placement.",Eye positions were measured with an embedded infrared eye-tracking module: aGlass DKI from 7invensun (https://www.7invensun.com),Ma:2018:CBI:3172944.3172988
Synchronization with stimuli and other signals,"For analyzing a continous stream of brain signal data, it needs to be synchronized to the events of the experiments (and potentially any other signal sources). This can be done through timestamps, trigger signals, light sensors or other means and the method may be reported to determine the precision of the achieved synchronization.","A parallel port connection between recording PC and experimental PC synchronized the EEG recording with the experimental events, such as the sound onset and button press.",Glatz:2018:URS:3173574.3174046
Recording Environment,"This point reports where and under what conditions the experiment was conducted. Of relevance can be the conditions regarding control of light, sound, electromagnetic fields as well as the positioning of the participant. This attribute is often illustrated through a photo or video of the environment.","#Scanners was presented in an intimate 6 person capacity cinema, within a caravan [...]. The space had no windows, low lighting, plush seating, an eight foot projected image, and stereo speakers. Figure 3 [shows a] participant wearing the EEG device, experiencing #Scanners inside the caravan.",Pike:2016:SEC:2858036.2858276
